Data modeling and data analysis with SQL


## Data Modeling and Engineering
I first previewed the six csv files provided for this project. I then typed in the table set ups into quickdatabasediagrams.com to help myself visualize how the tables are connected and what keys they had in common. I exported the code from there and opened PgAdmin 4 to create my database. 

I started with the code exported from quickdatabasediagrams.com and edited it to create composite keys as well as streamline which foreign keys I was using, ensuring no conflicts when I imported the data.

## Data Analysis
Now that my database tables were set up I had a few queries to run. They all ran smoothly, confirming I created a working employee database. 

As I examined the data I could see that it was indeed fake!
